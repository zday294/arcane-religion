# Oddly Specific Calculator

The problem with being a nerd in two different fields is that occasionally you ened up using your knowledge in one field to benefit you in another field. This project is just a really complicated way for me to figure out how much time and money I'm going to be wasting (in game) on learning religious spells. For now, the goal is to just run it as a script and that takes a bunch of csvs in and outputs another csv for me to read. Maybe later I'll add features to make it more interactable, but for now that's really all I need to do to get the calculations I need done quickly and repeatably.
